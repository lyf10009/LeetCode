    /**
     * Given an array of words and a length L, format the text such that each line has exactly L characters 
     * and is fully (left and right) justified.
     * You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. 
     * Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly L characters.
     * Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible.
     * If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, 
     * the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
     * For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no extra space is inserted between words.
     * For example,
     * words: ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
     * L: 16.
     * Return the formatted lines as:
     * [
     *    "This    is    an",
     *    "example  of text",
     *    "justification.  "
     * ]
     * Note: Each word is guaranteed not to exceed L in length.
